# Java-ALG-Problems

## Overview
This repository contains a variety of algorithmic problems implemented in Java. Focused on demonstrating skills in different aspects of algorithmic programming, from basics to more advenced concepts data structures.

## Problems-set

### P_01. Maximum 2D subarray
    -- finding max submatrix using Kadane's Algorithm

### P_02. Triangles
    -- binary search algorithm used to find geometrical silutions

### P_03. INF <=> RPN conversions.
    -- stack, conversation algorithms
    
### P_04. Bound letters
    -- doubly linked-list and linked-list structures

### P_05. 2D array search
    -- implemantations of specific algorithms with both recursive and iterative (stack) versions.

### P_06. Packing a backpack
    -- backpack problem.
    
### P_07. Effective QuickSort
    -- really effective quickSort with O(1) memory usage.
    
### P_08. Magic Fridays
    -- median of medians concept.
